    this method. Ideally, you will pass none, and that will be sufficient in the
    vast majority of cases. Think very carefully before adding any
    |factory_properties| here, as changing them will require a master restart.

    |timeout| refers to the maximum number of seconds a step should be allowed
    to run without output. After no output for |timeout| seconds, the step is
    forcibly killed.

    |max_time| refers to the maximum number of seconds a step should be allowed
    to run, regardless of output. After |max_time| seconds, the step is forcibly
    killed.
